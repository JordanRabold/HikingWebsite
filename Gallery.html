             As of late, there is a new slightly shorter trail to the top of this gruesome
             hike. In the past, hikers had to endure near vertical climbs to the top. Still,
             with the new trail, dont expect a cake walk. What rewards you at the end is a 
             Mailbox full of misc nick nacks that you can take and replace with something of
             your own, and lets not forget the bragging rights.

            Prepare to have your breath taken away as you round the tree covered corner
            and view the massive peaks of Dragontail and Colchuck behind a crystal clear blue lake.
            It's become a right of passage to take a dip in the lake at the end of your
            long journey to the top. Make sure to bring extra clothing as the water is near freezing.

            This two story fire lookout was built in 1934 and provides stunning 360 degree
            views of the surounding area of Mt. Rainier. Located just a short distance from the 
            Sunrise visitors center, enjoy views of massive plains, mountain goats, bears, and 
            one of the grandest views of Mt. Rainier on the mountain.

            Also located near the Sunrise visitor center in Mt. Rainier is my all time favorite hike
            in the park. The 2nd burroughs hike will take you incredibly close to the face of the mountain.
            Enjoy some warm lunch in a stone circle seating area prepared by a jetboil while you gaze upon
            the majestic views before you.
