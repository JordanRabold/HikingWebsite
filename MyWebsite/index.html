                <p>
                    "The mountains are calling, and I must go" - John Muir. This quote is what inspired me to take on hiking as a hobby all the way
                    back in 2014. I set off for my first hike in Mt. Rainier National Park called Comet Falls and never looked back, I was in love 
                    with the hobby. I have created this website to showcase some of my hikes around Washington state and to share them with my viewers. 
                    In this website you can find a gallery of my favorite hikes, decide what hiking gear you need and how much it will cost, and I'll show you some 
                    safety tips while hiking including the 10 essentials. I hope you enjoy your time viewing the beautiful landscape the Pacific Northwest
                    has to offer!

            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised here in Washington state, where I spent a lot of my summers camping across the Washington and Oregon
                    coast line. Here I discovered my love for the outdoors and the thrill for adventure. As I grew older and into adulthood, that love
                    has followed me through. I spend my summers doing about anything adventurous, including lots of hikes around Washington, white water 
                    rafting, and skydiving (eventhough I've only been once). I hope this website can inspire you to take those hiking boots by the 
                    strings and GO TAKE A HIKE!
